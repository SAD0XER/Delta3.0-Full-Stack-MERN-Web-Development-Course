    <!--Poem-->
    <p>
      I met a traveller from an antique land<br />
      Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
      Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,<br />
      Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
      And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
      Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
      Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
      The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:<br />
      And on the pedestal these words appear:<br />
      "My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, king of kings:<br />
      Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br />
      Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
      Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br />
      The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br />
    </p>
