# React-State-Class

Here I practiced all the concepts related to React Hooks alike `useState()`, `useEffect()`, etc.

## Create New React App using Vite

1. Run `npm create vite` To create vite environment and server.
   1. Add project name. (react-state-class)
   2. Select a framework.(react)
   3. Choose varient. (javascript)
2. Run `cd your-project-name` to nevigate to your react project.
3. Run `npm install` to install Node Modules.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the server and run the app.

> ðŸ’¡ Now you have done with setting REACT app, now you can open this app in browser.
